I help non-native speakers make Greek feel like home. From people in the Greek diaspora reconnecting with their roots, to devoted Greece-lovers who visit often and want the language to finally click, I guide students toward their personal Greek goals with clarity, structure, and a lot of human warmth. For over eight years, this has grown into a lively, supportive community—proof that you don’t need Greek blood to build a real bond with the language, just curiosity and the right guide.
